**About** the OmniWeek 11: In a week with the help of [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat/), specially [Diego](https://github.com/diego3g), I would develop full stack  software. In special this week would is Be The Hero.
 
## Project: Be The Hero!
The **concept ideia about the project is**: A lot of non-profits have cases (incidents) that they want to solve but they don't have enough manpower to do it, to solve that issue the Non-profit would access our system and share all the details about the case that they want to solve, and the reward for who solves it. In that concept was born **Be The Hero, a platform for web and mobile that would communicate the Non-Profits cases with their heroes.**
  
### Built with
- **[NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node)** for backend
	- [Celebrate](https://github.com/arb/celebrate), [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors), [Cross-Env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env), [Knex](https://github.com/knex/knex), [SqLite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3), and a few developer dependencies.
- **[ReactJs](https://github.com/facebook/react)** for frontend
	- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
